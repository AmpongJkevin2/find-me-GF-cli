A revolutionary, AI-powered, blockchain-ready, quantum-computed CLI tool to find you a girlfriend. Guaranteed to probably not work.

## The Problem

It's almost Valentine's Day, and you're single. Again. Swiping apps have failed you. Your friends have run out of people to set you up with. You're starting to think the problem might be you. It probably is.

But what if it's not? What if you just didn't have the right tool?

## The Solution

Introducing `find-me-gf`, the last dating tool you'll ever need. Using a sophisticated algorithm that we definitely didn't just make up, `find-me-gf` scans the entire globe (and several other dimensions) to find your perfect match.

### Features

*   **Advanced Filtering:** Search by age, and our CLI will do the rest.
*   **AI-Powered Matchmaking:** Our advanced AI (a bunch of `if` statements) analyzes your personality (or lack thereof) to find the most compatible partner.
*   **Catfish Detection:** We have a state-of-the-art catfish detection system. It's so good, it might even flag you.
*   **Dark Humor:** To match the darkness in your soul.
*   **100% Success Rate:** Of failing.

## Installation

You'll need Python 3 and pip. If you don't have them, maybe you should focus on that before trying to find a partner.

To install the package locally, run the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
pip install .
```
This will install all necessary dependencies and add the `find-me-gf` command to your system path.

### Publishing to PyPI (for the developer)

If you want to make this package available for everyone via `pip install find-me-gf`, you'll need to publish it to the Python Package Index (PyPI). You will need `build` and `twine`.

```bash
# Build the package
python -m build

# Upload to PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

## Usage

Once installed, simply run the command in your terminal:

```bash
find-me-gf
```

You can also pass arguments directly:
```bash
find-me-gf --min-age 20 --max-age 28
```

Follow the prompts. Be honest. Or don't. It doesn't matter.

## Bug Reports

If you run the tool and still can't find a girlfriend, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. We will look into it and probably tell you to lower your standards.

## Disclaimer

This is a joke. Please don't sue us if you end up with a cat. Or alone. If you're feeling lonely, talk to a friend, family member, or a mental health professional. Seriously.
