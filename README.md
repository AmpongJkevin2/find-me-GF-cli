## The Problem

It's almost Valentine's Day, and you're single. Again. Swiping apps have failed you. Your friends have run out of people to set you up with. You're starting to think the problem might be you. It probably is.

But what if it's not? What if you just didn't have the right tool?

## The Solution

Introducing `find-me-gf`, the last dating tool you'll ever need. Using a sophisticated algorithm that we definitely didn't just make up, `find-me-gf` scans the entire globe (and several other dimensions) to find your perfect match.

### Features

*   **Advanced Filtering:** Search by age, and our CLI will do the rest.
*   **AI-Powered Matchmaking:** Our advanced AI (a bunch of `if` statements) analyzes your personality (or lack thereof) to find the most compatible partner.
*   **Catfish Detection:** We have a state-of-the-art catfish detection system. It's so good, it might even flag you.
*   **Dark Humor:** To match the darkness in your soul.
*   **100% Success Rate:** Of failing.

## Installation

You'll need Python 3 and pip. If you don't have them, maybe you should focus on that before trying to find a partner.

Install the package directly from PyPI:
```bash
pip install find-me-gf
```
This will install the latest stable version and all necessary dependencies.

### Installation for Development

If you want to contribute to the project, you can install it locally from the source code.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AmpongJkevin2/find-me-GF-cli.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd find-me-GF-cli
    ```
3.  Install in editable mode:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Usage

Once installed, simply run the command in your terminal:

```bash
find-me-gf
```

You can also pass arguments directly:
```bash
find-me-gf --min-age 20 --max-age 28
```

Follow the prompts. Be honest. Or don't. It doesn't matter.

## Bug Reports

If you run the tool and still can't find a girlfriend, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AmpongJkevin2/find-me-GF-cli/issues). We will look into it and probably tell you to lower your standards.
